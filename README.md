# simple-book-objects
The Odin Project assignment to learn practice using objects.

4/3/2021

Creation of the project today. The plan for this project is to practice the use of objects by making a website that will keep tracks of books you've read and haven't read yet. There will be a way to add and remove books from the website, and all of the books that have been added will be displayed for the user.
